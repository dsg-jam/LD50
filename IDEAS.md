Theme: Delay the inevitable

## Round based games

### Power management game

- *Delay*ing a *power outage* by building new power plants and managing the sale of energy to customers *-> what is the inevitable part? does the consumtion grow and if so why?*

- tower defense style game

- a game where you have oxyen or something that runs out (maybe every move costs 1 part oxygen and you have to start over if you run out)

- failure is inevitable to complete the game
